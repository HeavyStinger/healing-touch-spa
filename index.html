                            " The process of setting an appointment was extremely smooth through WhatsApp. Manuel and Wendy were thorough and concentrated on the area we requested.
                            Left there feeling like a million bucks walking on the sand. Pretty good way to start your day after big island activities.
                            I'm sure the other massage places are fine but if you have big knots to work out, go here and see them "

It was sooo good! We came back two days later, before leaving the island, to enjoy this awesome treatment one last time. I can 110% recommend this place! The massage room is nice, the music relaxing, it's clean and the massage is perfect! Thank you! "
